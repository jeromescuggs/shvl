# shvl
automated mass messaging+scheduler

## notes
SHVL is a sort of two-layer title. SHV is the shortcode for Shreveport, the location of my workplace. However, it is also a nod to a former manager who had a knack for relentlessly sending out texts and phone calls, even if it was after midnight, or an hour before a shift. Although it was annoying at times, I found that it was a good way to remind someone like me, who is just a taaaddd bit ADHD, to set my alarms and whatnot. A large goal of this project will be to hopefully setup a cron job which will automatically send out the next day's start time, the evening before.

## other
remember to run `git submodule update --init` which will download the `html-vault` subfolder. you don't need it, but it's a nifty script that will take a file, encrypt it, and generate an HTML file. you can then post it publicly, but only those with the password will be able to view the encrypted contents. I used it here to encrypt the tokens needed to validate the program against the Textbelt service. If you're a pentester and come across this page, let me know how strong this method is! :)
